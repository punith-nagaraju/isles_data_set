Background 

Stroke segmentation plays a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic strokes, providing critical information regarding the size and location of lesions to guide clinical decisions and prognostic evaluations. Accurate segmentation allows healthcare professionals to assess the extent of brain damage and plan appropriate interventions more effectively. The accuracy of stroke lesion segmentation significantly impacts patient outcomes, as it directly influences treatment strategies and rehabilitation planning. Well-executed segmentation enhances the identification of affected brain regions, leading to better patient care and potentially improving recovery trajectories. Given the heterogeneous nature of stroke lesions, characterized by high variability in size, shape, and imaging modalities, achieving precise segmentation remains a notable challenge. Several challenges arise in stroke segmentation, including distinguishing stroke lesions from other abnormalities such as white matter hyperintensities or perivascular spaces. The presence of small lesions further complicates the task, where traditional algorithms may struggle to detect and segment them accurately. Moreover, varying imaging protocols and the presence of noise in MRI data can adversely affect segmentation performance. 
Ensemble learning techniques have emerged as a promising solution to improve segmentation performance by combining the strengths of multiple models. This approach enhances robustness and reduces the likelihood of overfitting associated with single models, making it particularly suitable for complex tasks such as stroke lesion segmentation. By leveraging diverse algorithms for segmentation, ensemble methods can average out individual model errors, resulting in improved accuracy and reliability in the segmentation process4.
