        "Bagging: This technique involves training multiple models on different subsets of the training data (created by sampling with replacement, although in your code, it appears you are using the full dataset for each model).

        "Model Averaging: In your ensemble_predict function (which is not fully shown in this snippet but implied by the averaging of predictions), the predictions from the individual trained models are combined by taking their average probability outputs. For segmentation tasks, this is a common way to combine predictions from different models. The final binary mask is then obtained by thresholding the averaged probabilities (e.g., (avg > 0.5).float()).\n",

        "A more common and practical approach for boosting with neural networks is Gradient Boosting, often implemented using frameworks like LightGBM or XGBoost. However, these are usually applied to tabular data or features extracted from images, not directly to the raw image data within the neural network training loop in the same way you're training your UNet/VNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing true boosting directly with your existing PyTorch models would be quite complex. A simplified approach that captures the spirit of boosting with neural networks might involve:\n",
        "\n",
        "Train a base model.\n",
        "Identify pixels where the base model made incorrect predictions.\n",
        "Train a second model, giving higher weight or focus to the misclassified pixels from the first model's predictions.\n",
        "Combine the predictions of the models, often with weights.\n",
        "This is still a significant departure from your current training loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the context of your existing code and the complexity of true boosting with deep learning architectures, a more feasible approach that aligns with your current structure would be to adapt a method that mimics some aspects of boosting or sequential training, but within the framework of your existing models.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to do this is to train models sequentially, and in each subsequent training phase, somehow influence the training data or loss function based on the errors of the previous model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a conceptual outline and some code snippets to illustrate this simplified \"sequential error focus\" approach using your existing UNet3D model. This is NOT a true AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting implementation but aims to show a sequential training process where later models pay more attention to areas where earlier models struggled.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conceptual Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Train the first UNet3D model on the full dataset.\n",
        "After training the first model, evaluate its performance on the training data to identify pixels where it performed poorly (e.g., where the predicted probability was close to 0.5 for the incorrect class).\n",
        "Create a weighting mask based on these errors. Pixels where the first model was uncertain or wrong get higher weights.\n",
        "Train a second UNet3D model, incorporating this weighting mask into the loss function (e.g., using a weighted Dice Loss). This encourages the second model to focus more on the challenging pixels.\n",
        "Optionally, repeat for more models.\n",
        "Combine the predictions of the models (e.g., weighted averaging)."
